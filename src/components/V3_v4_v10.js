//Assigned to:
//Fuctions: show v3 and v4 and v10 as required
//Requirements:
//Add this dataset to the previous temperature chart (Global historical surface temperature anomalies from January 1850 onwards) as an option,
//which the user can turn on and off. Use different colour to highlight this dataset. Provide a link to data measurement description https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html
//Write a brief description of the graph and its information
//Requirements on v10:
//Provide user toggleable option to display major human evolution and culture events in the following charts:
//Evolution of global temperature over the past two million years
//Antarctic Ice Core records of atmospheric CO2 ratios combined with Mauna Loa measurements
//You can add the human events as line chart point, but hiding the line (see https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html#line-styling).
//Use tooltips to provide information of the activity. If there are plenty of activities, choose especially those which in your opinion are relevant to co2 or temperature. For example:
//an event 1500 years ago should show text “crop failures across the northern hemisphere caused by volcanic eruptions in Iceland; then bubonic plague (536-547) → century of economic stagnation”
//242 years ago, eg. 1780 AD, should show text “mass production of spun textiles, mechanised by water power; coal-fired and steam-powered production of iron and steel (beginning Britain, c. 1780) → economies of scale, rising polarisation of rich and poor nations, dominance of fossil fuels”
